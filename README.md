# Mirage-Realms-API
A simple HTML/JS implementation for the Mirage Realms API

(Hopefully) easy to understand even if you dont know much about HTML/JS. Comments may or may not be helpful, and the code may or may not be good.

## Notes

You'll probably want to comment out/remove some of the data points (Do you REEEALLY need to know how much experience players have in each magic and mastery?) unless you want to have too many numbers that arent that useful in the end. You could also split the code into separate search engines for different skills? Do whatever, I don't care!

If you don't like the plain HTML look, just throws the paragraphs inside a div or something, should be easy enough to add some css to make it suit your tastes.

Use as you want, credit me if you want.
